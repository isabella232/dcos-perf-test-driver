observers:

  # The marathon poller is polling various marathon endpoints, such as `/groups`
  # or `/v2/deployments` and is extracting events similar to the event observer
  #
  # NOTE: Since marathon is dropping some of the events in the eventBus, the
  #       `observer.MarathonEventsObserver` is not very reliable, thus we are
  #       using this one.
  #
  - class: observer.MarathonPollerObserver
    url: "{{marathon_url}}"

  # The metrics observer samples the /metrics endpoint and emmits their
  # value updates to the event bus.
  - class: observer.MarathonMetricsObserver
    url: "{{marathon_url}}/metrics"
