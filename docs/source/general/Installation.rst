Installation
============

The ``dcos-perf-test-driver`` can be installed as a standard python module
using ``pip``. However since the project is not publicly available in PyPI
so you will need to point it to the github repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install git+https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-perf-test-driver

If the installation was successful, the ``dcos-perf-test-driver`` binary should
be now available.

Continue to :ref:`cmdline` for more information regarding the command-line
interface or to :ref:`introduction` to get more familiar with the tool.
